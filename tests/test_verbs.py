"""The management verbs: they answer, they never call the model, they never print a
secret (2026-09-22).

`tinycmdr status|doctor|model|logs|token` exist because day-two work used to mean
hand-editing .env and config.json. What has to hold: a verb is a management operation,
so no verb starts the agent loop or spends a token; a verb that reports on secrets names
them and never prints them; and a verb that fails says why on stderr with a non-zero exit,
so a script can act on it.
